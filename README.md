AirBnB Clone
The goal of this project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

We wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

Our application will be composed by:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell
- A website that shows the final: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data
